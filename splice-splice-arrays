The full syntax of the splice() method is as follows:  Array.splice(start, removeCount, newItem, newItem, newItem, ...)

const arr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
let newArr = arr.slice();       //copy arr, maintain immutability of arr
newArr.splice(1, 4)          // removes 1,2,3,4 from the newArr


ADD and REMOVE array values at once:
let months = ["January", "February", "Monday", "Tuesday"];
let days = months.splice(2, 2, "March", "April");

console.log(days); // ["Monday", "Tuesday"]
console.log(months); // ["January", "February", "March", "April"]




You are given two arrays and an index.
Copy each element of the first array into the second array, in order.
Begin inserting elements at index n of the second array.
Return the resulting array. The input arrays should remain the same after the function runs.


function frankenSplice(arr1, arr2, n) {
  let arr3 = arr2.slice();
  for (let i=0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
    arr3.splice(n, 0, arr1[i]);
    n++;
  }
  return arr3;
}

frankenSplice([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], 1);


##Create a new array from arr2 using slice, then iterate through arr1, and  use the splice() function to insert the item into index n of arr3.
