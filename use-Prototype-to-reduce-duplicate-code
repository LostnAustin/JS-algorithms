Using the `prototype` method in the constructor reduces duplicate copies of variables if you have other objects. For instance many objects would all create duplicate variables




function Dog(name) {
  Dog.prototype.numLegs = 2;
  this.name = name;
}



// Only change code above this line
let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");
