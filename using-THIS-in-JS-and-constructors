-Using 'this' makes functions and code more reusable, especially if changes need to be made late to constants, variables, and functions.

-'this' is used in constructors to bind data and props also





CONSTRUCTORS

Constructors are defined with a capitalized name to distinguish them from other functions that are not constructors.
Constructors use keyword 'this' to set properties of the object they will create. Inside the constructor, 'this' refers to the new object it will create.
Constructors define properties and behaviors instead of returning a value as other functions might.


function Dog() {
  this.name = "Rupert";
  this.color = "brown";
  this.numLegs = 4;
}

let hound = new Dog();





Create a Dog constructor. This time, set it up to take the parameters name and color, and have the property numLegs fixed at 4. Then create a new Dog saved in a variable terrier. Pass it two strings as arguments for the name and color properties.

function Dog(name, color) {
  this.name = name;
  this.color = color;
  this.numLegs = 4
}

var terrier = new Dog();
