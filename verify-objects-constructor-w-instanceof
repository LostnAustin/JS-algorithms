When a constructor function creates a new object, it is defined as a 'instaneof' operator. This operator allows a comparison of an object to a constructor, returning a true/false response depending on if the object was created with a constructor



function House(numBedrooms) {
  this.numBedrooms = numBedrooms;
}

let numBedrooms = 2
let myHouse = new House(numBedrooms);

myHouse instanceof House;
