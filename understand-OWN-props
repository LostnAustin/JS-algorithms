'own' properties are defined directly on the instanc object. Each object will have its own separate cop of the defined properties



function Bird(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.numLegs = 2;
}

let canary = new Bird("Tweety");
let ownProps = [];
// Only change code below this line

for (let property in canary) {
  if(canary.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
    ownProps.push(property);
  }
}
